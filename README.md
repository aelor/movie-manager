# movie-manager

Made using Microsoft Visual Studio Community edition and TMDB api.

##Limitations
- Currently only looks in the `D:\\Movies` folder for movies.
- A folder named `art` must be present within the `D:\\Movies` folder for the app to work, this is the place where all the downloaded album arts will be kept.
